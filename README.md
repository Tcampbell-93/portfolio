# portfolio

## Description
In this project I learned a lot about coding the front end of React. I built a portfolio demonstrating some of my previous projects. My hope is to use this portfolio for future job oportunities and to demonstrate my new found coding skills. 

## Installation 
When you open the app in the root file run npm install to install all the dependencies.

## Usage
To use this app you can switch between the four nav tabs: about me, portfolio, resume, and contact. On the about me page you will see a picture of me and a short description about me. On the Resume page I have listed languages I am proficient in and there is a button to download a copy of my resume. On the contact page you can enter your name email and a short message. There is also my contact information on the right. On the portfolio page is a list of 6 previous projects I have worked on. There is a link to each project's deployed site and github repositories. At the bottom is a link to my Github, LinkedIn, and Facebook page. 
Thank you for visiting my site.
